### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, My name is Ilya!)
#### Android in my green (or gray) heart
I am an android developer and I, probably like everyone else, like to learn something new, in which I see difficulties for myself. Currently, I am working and running one of the major federal auto parts service projects in Russia (AvtoTO), apps market: Androeed and food service in USA: CityCheers. But in my free time I write my own projects (for example, a vpn application, a discount card wallet). I invest original chips in my projects (such as smart vpn traffic mode for applications, auto-search for discount cards by location, etc..). Currently I am studying jetpack compose, Kotlin-multiplatform and the basics of KSP (Kotlin Symbol Processing API). Something like this :)

Skills: Kotlin / Java / XML ðŸ”­
